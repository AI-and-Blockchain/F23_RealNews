We are going to create and store posts on the blockchain but we are going to store all of the long text items off the 
chain and simply store their IPFS hash on the chain so we can access them.

what a post will probably look like on the chain

struct Post{
    id: int
    claimHash: 
    factCheckerHash:
    upvotes: int
    downvotes: int
}

example workflow:
1. a user on the front end posts something
2. we take that claim and generate a response from google bard
3. create json file from that information
{
    claim: "",
    response: ""
}

4. upload that file to IPFS and get the hash
5. call our contract and create a post on the chain. For now it will only have an ID and the claimHash
6. Once its posted a factchecker can see it and do their job
7. fact checker will upload a conclusion and their links we will create a json file from that and store it on IPFS
{
    factual: bool,
    conclusion: string,
    links: ["string"]
}
8. we will get that hash and update the original post on the chain with the factCheckerHash
9. Anytime someone upvotes or downvotes we call the contract and simply increment the numbers
