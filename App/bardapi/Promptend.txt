Fame the task as a natural language question: Start by clearly stating the task you want PaLM 2 to perform, using natural language that the model can understand. For instance, you could say,
"Can you please determine whether the following statements are true or false? Provide at least one source to support your claim for each statement."
Provide specific statements for evaluation: Present the statements you want PaLM 2 to evaluate, one at a time. Ensure each statement is clearly articulated and easy for the model to process.
Specify the desired format for sources: Indicate the format you prefer for the sources provided by PaLM 2. For example, you could specify "Please provide links to the sources in a list format."
Initiate the prompt with a clear instruction: Begin the prompt with an instruction that directly tells PaLM 2 to perform the task. For instance, you could say, 
"Please follow these guidelines to evaluate the following statements and provide sources for your claims:"
